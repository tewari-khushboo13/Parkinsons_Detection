Parkinson's Disease Detection
Overview
This repository hosts the code and documentation for a machine learning project aimed at detecting Parkinson's Disease (PD) using feature selection techniques and predictive modeling. We employ L1 and L2 regularized Support Vector Machines (SVM) for feature selection, and a neural network for training the prediction model. The highlight of this project is achieving a model accuracy of 100%.
Objective
The primary objective of this project is to:
1.Implement effective feature selection methods to identify the most significant features that contribute to Parkinson's disease.
2.Develop and train a neural network model to predict the presence of Parkinson's disease with high accuracy.
3.Explore the impact of L1 and L2 regularization in SVM on the feature selection process and overall model performance.
